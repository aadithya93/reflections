When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping the work local?
Remote repository is useful when working on a project from multiple machines or when multiple people collaborate and work on a 
project.

Why might you always want to pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manually pulling changes lets you decide when to sync your remote with the local repository. If you are in the middle of a new update, you dont have to
pull the changes and deal with the conflicts. But you can finish the update and later fix the conflicts. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches are made within a repository. 
Forks are copying a reposity on github into your account. The changes made in the forked repository is not reflected in the parent repository.
Clone is making a copy of a local repository on github or vice versa. You need to perform pull and push to sync the remote and local repositories.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
To keep track of your local branch and the remote branches. This helps to idendify if we need to perform a merge commit or a fost forward merge
when doing a git pull.
