When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping the work local?
Remote repository is useful when working on a project from multiple machines or when multiple people collaborate and work on a 
project.

Why might you always want to pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manually pulling changes lets you decide when to sync your remote with the local repository. If you are in the middle of a new update, you dont have to
pull the changes and deal with the conflicts. But you can finish the update and later fix the conflicts.
