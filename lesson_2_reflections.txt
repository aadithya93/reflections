What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing adds the .git file to the directory to indicate that the directory is a
git repository. It needs to be done to perform other git operations like commit, log
etc.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What
value do you think it offers?
Staging area acts as an intermediate bucket between the working directory and the 
repository. The working directory consists of the latest changes made locally. 
Repository consists of the files till the last commit(need not be up to date as in WD).
Staging area can be used to selectively make commits from the WD to make logical sense.
